# Shadow-OS
Fun mock-operating system

Our task was to create a mock-operating system that specializes in a particular department. We chose tailsOS as an operating system to model after because we
wanted to focus on security. The operating system consists of the following features: 

   **Feature 1 - User Input: userInput -> RAM;**
   
   **Feature 2 - Load program: copy RAM -> CPU;**
   
   *Extra Feature 1: encrypt CPU*
   
   **Feature 3 - Refresh RAM: transfer CPU -> RAM**  
   
   *Extra Feature 2: decrypt RAM*
   
   **Feature 4 - User Output: output RAM -> txt file ( userOutput )**
   
   *Extra Feature 3: Clear all files*
